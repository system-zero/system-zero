## You

The intention of this branch of development, is to built a User Interface tailored to
this system.

As such we might sacrifice during the development, some abstraction. Ideally this should
not happen, so we'll try hard to extend the API as far it gets, before it could be used
by the clients for their specific tasks, with as little code it gets. Abstraction is
priceless!

We do this, because we believe that the system _should_ be adapted to the human being
and not the other way around. Personalization is of an incalculable value, and our hunt
pilgrim!

So we owe to our system that give us the tools to do what we want to do, and with the
exact way we like to do. Appreciation is about justice and justice is objective!

The rest is conscience fighter!

At the end is you and it. And this is the beginning.
