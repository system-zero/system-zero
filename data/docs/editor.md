  In this implementation while performing a search, the focus do not change
  until user accepts the match. The results and the dialog, are shown at the
  bottom lines (the message line as the last line on screen).
  It searches just once in a line, and it should highlight the captured string
  with a proper message composed as:

    |line_nr byte_index| matched line

  See at Regexp section for details.

  Line operation mode:
  This is triggered with 'L' in normal mode and for now can:
    - send current line to shared register
    - send current line to XA_CLIPBOARD (a LN appended)
    - send current line to XA_CLIPBOARD (NO LN appended)
    - send current line to XA_PRIMARY (a LN appended)
    - send current line to XA_PRIMARY (NO LN appended)

  File operation mode:
  This is triggered with 'F' in normal mode and for now can:
    - validate current buffer for invalid UTF8 byte sequences
    - write this file

  Command line mode:
  (note) Commands do not get a range as in vi[like], but from the command line
  switch --range=. Generally speaking the experience in the command line should
  feel more like a shell and specifically the zsh completion way.

  On Normal mode, it is possible to map native language to normal mode commands.
  Here is a sample:

  int lmap[2][26] = {{
    913, 914, 936, 916, 917, 934, 915, 919, 921, 926, 922, 923, 924,
    925, 927, 928, ':', 929, 931, 932, 920, 937, 931, 935, 933, 918},{
    945, 946, 968, 948, 949, 966, 947, 951, 953, 958, 954, 955, 956,
    957, 959, 960, ';', 961, 963, 964, 952, 969, 962, 967, 965, 950
  }};

  Ed.set.lang_map (this, lmap);

  These correspond to 'A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z' respectively.

  Auto completions (triggered with tab):
    - commands
    - arguments
    - filenames

  Command completion is triggered when the cursor is at the first word token.
  (note: and also by default, and when the first char is one of the "`~@" set).

  Arg completion is triggered when the first char word token is an '-' or
  when the current command, gets a bufname as an argument.

  In any other case a filename completion is performed.

  note: that if an argument (like a substitution string) needs a space, it should be
  quoted

  If a command takes a filename or a bufname as an argument, tab completion
  will quote by default the argument (for embedded spaces): this mechanism
  uses the --fname= argument.

  Options are usually long (that means prefixed with two dashes), unless some
  established/unambiguous like (for now):
    -i  for interactive
    -r  for recursive

  Default command line switches:
    --range=...
      valid ranges:
      --range=%              for the whole buffer
      --range=linenr,linenr  counted from 1
      --range=.              for current line
      --range=[linenr|.],$   from linenr to the end
      --range=linenr,. from  linenr to current line
     without --range         assumed current line number

    --global          is like the g flag on vim substitute
    --interactive,-i  is like the c flag on vim substitute
    --append          is like  >> redirection (used when writing to another file)

    --pat=`pat'       pat is a string that describes the pattern.
                     For more details see at Regexp section below to this document.

    --sub=`replacement string' but see at Regexp section for details.

  Commands:
  ! as the last character indicates force, unless is a shell command.

  :s[ubstitute] [--range=] --pat=`pat' --sub=`sub' [-i,--interactive] [--global]
  :w[rite][!] [filename  [--range] [--append]] (when the buffer is modified externally this aborts or raises a question if `force')
  :w[rite]!!  [filename  [--range] [--append]] (likewise, but write unconditionally)
  :wq[!]                 (write and quit (if force, do not check for modified buffers))
  :e[!] [filename]       (when e!, reread from current buffer filename)
  :enew [filename]       (new buffer on a new window)
  :etail                 (like :e! and 'G' (reload and go at the end of file))
  :split [filename]      (open filename at a new frame)
  :b[uf]p[rev]           (buffer previous)
  :b[uf]n[ext]           (buffer next)
  :b[uf][`|prevfocused]  (buffer previously focused)

                          ednew can use a filename as argument)
  :r[ead] filename       (read filename into current buffer)
